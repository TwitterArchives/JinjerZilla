The internet was in development for years before the military and government DECIDED to allow the public to use it- same for GPS.  We made a choice.  We have the collective agency to decide what we allow.  Technology is made by US- we are not made by it.

My father worked in retail management (and i maintain it killed him).  And now I write code.  Every great grandfather before him i have found had his occupations listed as "Tool Maker".

If you can't give your son his skills, what can you give him?  I support the enforced deceleration of technological advancement.  Only thru this can regain inter-generational continuity. https://twitter.com/Trad_West_Art/status/1300076919376023557

Anakin was the youth and vigor of a bright future.  Vader was the of the cost to get there- the embodiment of the tragedy of the one willing to act never getting to enjoy the fruits of his sacrifice.

They were just future members of the cult of Jedi, each already 8-10 years into their indoctrination.  The Jedi destroyed their lives.  Anakin just protected the rest of galaxy from them.

Even 20 years ago our "product" bore the optimism of a ppl with a future.  Everything was colorful and confident.  Now everything is "gritty" and "dark"- the bleak reflection of a ppl who cant envision a future.

I'm saying your faith is much more a part of you when you're born with it.  I have lapsed in my faith many times- but its so deeply part of me that i always return because of that rootedness.

Having cultural cohesion is not a reduction.  That said, the church has lost it's morality- not it's transcendence.

One of Catholicism's best traits has been its adaption to the culture of the ethnicity/race practicing it.  European Catholicism is distinctly European.  And Catholicism never brought out the best in a people as much as it did in Europeans.

The fact that she’s reporting you for violating Jewish imposed norms is not her fault.  It’s ours for not protecting her from such an infection.  Find a Karen and cleanse her.
